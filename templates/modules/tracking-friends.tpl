						<h1>Friends comparison - coming soon!</h1>
						<p>Soon we will be launching an exciting new feature which allows you to link rounds with your friends! If you've taken part in a round with your friends, and they have added their scores to {$domain.pagetitle}, you can link their scores with yours and view them side by side on the same chart. This adds a great element of sporting rivalry between you and your friends!</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Linking rounds with friends is just the beginning! As the friends system develops, you'll be able to do the following:</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h2>Organise rounds with friends</h2>
						<p>Use {$domain.pagetitle} to organise rounds with friends and track the results afterwards.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
						<p class="bullet">Create round location, time and date, minimum number of players, then invite friends to join.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Set-up wagers for winning each hole, front 9, back 9 or entire round.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Automatically keep a running table of winners</p>
						<p class="bullet">Players who add their round scores to {$domain.pagetitle} will have them automatically added to the rounds results page.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<h2>Create your own golf competition or league</h2>
						<p>Why just arrange the odd round when you can create a competition or league?</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
						<p class="bullet">Create a league or competition, then invite friends to join.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Choose type of league or competition - knock-out, matchplay, traditional, etc.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Create round locations, time and date, select players or let {$domain.pagetitle} generate the draw.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Set-up entry fees and prizes for winning league or competitions.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Set-up additional games and prizes within a competition, such as longest drive and closest to the pin.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Automatically keep a running league table and competition results list.</p>
						<p class="bullet">Players must add their round scores to {$domain.pagetitle} in order to keep their position in a league or competition. The league or course administrator can also do this on a players behalf.</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<p>Plus even more to come!</p>
