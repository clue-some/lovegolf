	<h1>Handicap tracking</h1>
	<p>When you add a round you can choose whether or not to track your handicap.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you chose to track your handicap, a green tick will appear in the Hcp column.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you chose not to track your handicap, a red cross will appear.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Once a round has been added, you can't change this setting later on. If you've added a round and not tracked your handicap correctly, but know what it should have changed to, you can edit you handicap within <a href="/my/profile-edit/">your profile</a>.</p>
