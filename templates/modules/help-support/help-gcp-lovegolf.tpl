	<h1>What's different about {$domain.pagetitle}?</h1>
	<p>We've improved upon many features used by Golf Card Plus, so you'll notice that the {$domain.pagetitle} website looks and functions a little differently.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Here's an outline of those differences:</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Clubs & courses</h2>
	<p>On Golf Card Plus you were required to add courses yourself if they weren't already in the database. We've removed this for {$domain.pagetitle} as we felt it gave our users too much work to do and also led to the inevitable duplication and/or inaccuracy of data.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>By managing the club and course data ourselves we can verify that the data is correct, and that the tee's you play from when you add a round have the correct par, SI and yardage. However, we are still in the process of verifying clubs and courses, so not all tee's in the database are considered 100% accurate.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>European clubs & courses</h2>
	<p>Right now {$domain.pagetitle} is aimed at the UK and Irish market, so we no longer have european or worldwide clubs and courses in the database. These will be added in due time. When they are, any rounds that you've added to such courses will become available again. We realise that UK and Irish golfers often play abroad, so we aim to have the necessary data asap.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Handicapping</h2>
	<p>Golf Card Plus didn't allow for players to add or track their handicaps. {$domain.pagetitle} addresses this with an accurate handicap system that can track your handicap with each round you add. The calculations are made using the CONGU&reg; system.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>As you have already added rounds using your Golf Card Plus account, these have been ported across to {$domain.pagetitle} which means we're unable to generate your inital handicap. If you have a handicap you can enter it manually on the <a href="/my/profile-edit/">Edit my profile</a> page within <a href="/my/profile-edit/">My account</a>. If you don't have one, you'll be given the default handicap of 28.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Stableford points</h2>
	<p>{$domain.pagetitle} automatically generates your stableford points each time you add a round. A handicap is needed for this which is why we ask you to enter it or accept the default one. A new section is coming soon to the <a href="/tracking-centre/">tracking centre</a> which let's you track your stableford performance.</p>
