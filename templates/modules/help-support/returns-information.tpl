<h1>Returns Information</h1>
<h2>Guarantees and Returns Policy</h2>
<p>We want you to be totally satisfied with every purchase you make with LoveGolf.co.uk. It is our aim to offer you value and quality at outstandingly low prices. So if, for any reason, you are not completely happy with your purchase, simply follow the returns procedure below and return the goods within 
14 days of delivery <strong>unused</strong> and in its original condition. You have a duty to take reasonable care whilst the goods are in your possession and also advise the use of original packaging to insure that the goods are not damaged on its return journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your decision, we'll exchange or refund you for items that have been returned to us. We offer outstanding value in the products that 
we sell by having a discounted shipping structure. In-order to maintain such low prices and top service <strong>we do not offer a refund on the 
delivery costs</strong> if an order is returned after the 14 day grace period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some products are excluded from the 14 Day Money Back Guarantee. These would normally include personalised or customized products and for more information please contact us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, after the initial 14 days grace period all Love Golf products are guaranteed against manufacturing defects for a minimum of 12 months (return to base) unless stated otherwise from the date of <strong>first</strong> delivery. All guarantees offered are <strong>Return To Base</strong> (except Powakaddies and some products where stated). This works very similar to in-store guarantees where you will have to return faulty product back 
to store where purchased. Return to base states that in order to get a faulty product exchanged (or to claim under guarantee), the goods have to be returned back our base/warehouse at your own cost (or directly to manufacturer, whichever has a lower return-cost). Please contact us if you are unsure or require more information on returns, guarantees and how they operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you require return of a product due to a fault or manufacturing defect within the first 12 months, you may also complete the Returns procedure given below. You may send back the faulty/defective goods at your own cost or you may contact us for a quote for collection (only available within Mainland UK).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon receipt of the returned goods we will pass the goods on to the appropriate manufacturer who will then inspect the product at their discretion. The manufacturer will repair or replace the faulty part, or may even exchange the entire product when the product is found as FAULTY. A free return delivery 
is normally offered for the replacement back to you if the goods are found faulty. If the cost of replacement is not cost-effective, we shall offer you vouchers for the value of the returned-goods or offer you an alternative with your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some rare cases when there is shortage of replacement parts, or if further fault investigation is required, there may be a major delay in completing the return. In such cases, we will regularly keep you informed whilst we await a decision from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event where the goods are found non-faulty or if the product does not have a manufacturing-fault (through a fault investigation process), the warranty claim will be voided and goods will be sent back in its current condition. In most cases we may request a minimal shipping charge to cover for the return cost back to you.</p>

<h2>Returns Procedure:</h2>
<p>To return a product you need to obtain a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number. You need to apply for an RMA Request to return any incorrectly supplied/faulty or damaged items. <strong>NO returns of any type will be accepted without an RMA number. Please follow the simple procedure given below to apply for an RMA:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Login to your account using your email address and password.</p>
<p>2. Once logged in, click on the 'My account' tab in the main navigation.</p>
<p>3. Click on 'Order history' from the menu on the left. A list of previous orders will be displayed. Please click on the order to view order details. Click on the 'Need to return this product?' link to submit the RMA request.</p>
<p>4. A RMA request form will be displayed on screen. Please complete the form providing full information regarding the item in the comments box. You may complete the returns-form even though you may only be returning an individual component of the product.</p>
<p>5. Submit the form. Upon submission a unique RMA reference number will be issued to you. Please note this number down as you may require it for future correspondence. An email confirmation will also follow with the RMA details.</p>
<p>6. To prevent any confusion, we do not ship out any replacements until the goods have been received back to our warehouse for returns-processing. However if faulty goods have been received and replacements are urgent then we may arrange to ship out a replacement product (if in stock). Please note for such scenarios the customer will be required to pay the full amount for the replacement goods whilst the faulty product is on its way to us, and upon receipt of the faulty product a full refund will be passed for the new amount paid.</p>
<p>7. Your request is sent to our Returns Team who will then reply by e-mail and inform you of the outcome.</p>
