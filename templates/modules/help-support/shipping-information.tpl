To remove the VAT charge from your order, simply enter the following comments in box during checkout: "PLEASE REMOVE VAT AS SHIPPING OUTSIDE EU". If it is not obvious from the delivery address that the destination is outside the EU then we will require a copy of a VAT Exemption form (form will be emailed upon request) signed by your Commanding Officer.</p>

    <p>* Please note: There will be an additional surcharge to be paid for shipping to Islands and certain extended areas in Spain, Portugal and Italy. It is your responsibility to advise us of this remote zone (or check with us) before placing an order stating that your delivery falls outside the mainland area.

		<p>In some cases where goods cannot be sent under one consignment for e.g. an Electric Trolley and a Golf Bag (which requires two separate shipments), we may request for an additional shipping charge if cost of delivery is exceptionally high. In this case you will be advised before processing your order at which point you can either accept charge and continue dispatch or amend order (i.e. remove some items in order to ship under one consignment ), or you may cancel entire order.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Important Shipping Information</h2>
		<p>Most orders are delivered on weekdays (Between 8:30am to 6:00pm) to your door within the time specified. Please note for most items the recipient is required to sign for the goods on delivery. Shipping takes place only on working days therefore no dispatches are made on weekends or public holidays. For items that are not usually held in stock, please allow an additional 5-10 working days for delivery - for which you will be advised soon after order has been received. Should there be any unexpected further delay, we will notify you at the earliest opportunity (and you can cancel your order at any time if the delay is unacceptable to you). To track your parcel please follow the instructions in the despatch confirmation email we send once the goods leave our premises. Please note that the delivery times stated here are an approximate guide passed on to us by the couriers, and therefore they may vary with different addresses, postcodes and locations across the world.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Please note although every effort is made to deliver goods on time and date specified, we are at the mercy of our couriers and unforseen delays may still take place under situations beyond our control for e.g. bad weather conditions, severe traffic problems, sorting errors, goods lost or stolen etc. Once the goods have been collected from our premises by the courier, we no longer have any control of the delivery of the goods. Although delivery delays are rare, we cannot be held responsible for the late delivery of an item once goods have been handed over to the third party agent. For the avoidance of doubt, lovegolf.co.uk will not refund the standard delivery charge if the courier have failed to deliver the item(s) on an anticipated delivery date. The couriers are currently working between 95-98% efficiency level and therefore most goods are delivered on time.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h2>Important Stock Information</h2>
		<p>In the rare event when certain items in your order run out of stock, for instance overnight orders or simultaneous orders, and we are unable to dispatch your goods to you, we shall contact you via e-mail/telephone to advise you of the situation. You will of course have the option to cancel 
		your order at this point or opt for an alternative option if available.</p>
