	<h1>We have checked all the tees for <a href="{$club.website}" target="_blank">{$club.name}</a> and verified that they are accurate.</p>
	<h2>Why do we verify tees?</h2>
	<p>Love Golf maintains its club database, which means our users can't add new tees to courses like they can on other golf tracking websites. We do this is so that we can offer you the most accurate course data possible. Once a club is verified, you'll only see one of each of the tees that exist within the course(s) at that club, and you can be safe in the knowledge that our data will match up with the courses you play on.</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>How do we verify tees?</h2>
	<p>We use various methods to verify tee data with golf clubs. The most common is checking the golf club's website. Of course, not all golf clubs have websites, and some that do don't publish their scorecard information online. In these cases we try to obtain an actual scorecard or contact them via telephone.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>If you believe that an error still exists on any of these tees, <a href="/report-scorecard/">please report it here.</a></p>
