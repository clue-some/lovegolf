	<h1>Handicap generation</h1>
	<p>If you don't already have a handicap, {$domain.pagetitle} can automatically calculate one for you from your first 3 rounds.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>To do this, you need to be given the maximum handicap from which your actual handicap will be generated. The maximum handicap is defined by your age and sex, which is why we ask for this information during activation.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>For men (17 years +) the maximum handicap is 28.</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>For women (17 years +) the maximum handicap is 36.</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>For juniors (up to 16 years) the maximum handicap is 54.</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Once you've entered 3 handicap tracked rounds into {$domain.pagetitle}, your handicap will be adjusted from the maximum assigned to you, and that will become your handicap.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>For example if an adult male, after his handicap has been generated, has a 3.2 reduction, his handicap will be 25 [28 - 3.2 = 24.8 actual handicap, 25 playing handicap].</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Actual & playing handicaps</h2>
	<p>Handicaps use decimal points, and for playing purposes are rounded up or down to the nearest whole number.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Anything from .1 to .4 is rounded <strong>down</strong>, and anything from .5 to .9 is rounded <strong>up</strong>.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>So an actual handicap of 20.2 is a playing handicap of 20.</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><strong>And an actual handicap of 20.5 is a playing handicap of 21.</strong></p>
