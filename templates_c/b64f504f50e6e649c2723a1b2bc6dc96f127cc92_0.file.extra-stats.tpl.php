	<h1>How does <?php echo $_smarty_tpl->tpl_vars['domain']->value['pagetitle'];?>
 work?</h1>
	<h2>Entering your scores</h2>
	<p>By simply entering your strokes per hole, we can provide a wide range of stats and reports, plus calculate your handicap and stableford points.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>However, if you enter more information about your round, we can give you back even more detailed analysis that can help vastly improve your game.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Print a special scorecard for your club</h2>
	<p>To make recording extra data easy, you can print a special extended scorecard directly from the <?php echo $_smarty_tpl->tpl_vars['domain']->value['pagetitle'];?>
 website. Simply visit the <a href="/clubs/">Club Directory</a> and choose the course and tee you'll be playing from. Then click on the 'print scorecard' button and you're ready to go!</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>What extra data can I add?</h2>
	<p><strong>Here are the extra data fields that you can add to <?php echo $_smarty_tpl->tpl_vars['domain']->value['pagetitle'];?>
:</strong></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>FIR</h3>
	<p><strong>Fairways in Regulation</strong> - Did you hit the fairway in regulation or not? Tell us where your ball landed and we can show you detailed tee shot analysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>GIR</h3>
	<p><strong>Greens in Regulation</strong> - Did you hit the green in regulation or not? Enter this data and we can show you detailed approach shot analysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Sand Save</h3>
	<p>Did you play out of a greenside bunker then hole the ball with 1 putt? Tell us each time you attempted a sand save and whether you hit or missed the putt, and we can show you detailed greenside bunker shot analysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Up & Down</h3>
	<p>Did you get the ball into the hole in two strokes and make par when starting from off the green? Enter this data and we can show you detailed par saving analysis.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Putting</h3>
	<p>Tell us how many putts you took on each hole. We'll show you your putting averages, lowest/highest putts in a round, plus more.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h3>Penalties</h3>
	<p>No one likes taking a drop, but tell us when you do and you can keep track of them. Visualise the holes that cause you the most trouble and beat them.</p>
