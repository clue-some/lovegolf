<p>In the UK & Irish Republic, a "Scratch Score" system was previously in place in order to rate courses and be fair to golfers of varying ability, and to make allowances that courses may play "easier" or "harder" than par, overall, to the amateur field. For this reason, a Standard Scratch Score (SSS) is used as a baseline for how the course plays in practice (e.g. an SSS lower than par indicates a course which golfers find slightly easier, and vice versa).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, Golf Card Plus requires the SSS for each course (add tee) so that it can calculate your handicap.</p>
