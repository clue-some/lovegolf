<p>Giving each round you add a name makes it easy to find when you look back over your rounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can call your rounds anything you like, for example, 'Saturday morning round with Paul, Nick and Janet'. When you look back at your previous rounds, the date it was played is also shown, making it easy to identify each round.</p>
