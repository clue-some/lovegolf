<p>Colours are assigned to each tee on a course. These vary across courses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each course that is added to Golf Card Plus must have at least one tee assigned to it. Normally this will be the tee that you usually play from the most. If you are playing in a competition or if you have to play on a different tee than normal due to bad weather or course maintenance, you will need to add the appropriate tee to the course if it does not already exist.</p>
